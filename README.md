# ESP8266 Buzzer Active Passive Module Project

#### Project Overview
This project illustrates how to use an active/passive buzzer with an ESP8266 microcontroller. The buzzer is controlled based on a simulated alarm condition, where the buzzer will sound if the alarm is triggered.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Buzzer (Active or Passive)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Button or Sensor (optional for triggering the alarm)**
- **Breadboard (optional)**

#### Block Diagram

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Buzzer to ESP8266:**
   - **Buzzer Positive Lead:** Connect to GPIO2 on the ESP8266.
   - **Buzzer Negative Lead:** Connect to the GND pin on the ESP8266.
   - **Optional Sensor/Button:** Connect one side to GPIO0 and the other side to GND (with an appropriate pull-up resistor if necessary).

#### Instructions
1. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed.
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, and select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor.
   - Press the button or trigger the sensor connected to GPIO0 to simulate an alarm condition.
   - You should hear the buzzer sound and see a message in the Serial Monitor indicating the alarm is triggered.

#### Code Explanation
- **Pin Definitions:** The buzzer is connected to GPIO2.
- **Setup Function:** Initializes the buzzer pin as an output and begins Serial communication.
- **Loop Function:** Continuously checks the state of GPIO0 (assumed to be connected to a button or sensor). If the alarm is triggered, the buzzer is activated, and a message is printed to the Serial Monitor.

#define BUZZER_PIN 2  // GPIO2

void setup() {
    pinMode(BUZZER_PIN, OUTPUT);
    Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
    // Simulate an alarm condition
    bool alarmTriggered = digitalRead(0); // Assume a button or sensor connected to GPIO0

    if (alarmTriggered) {
        digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, HIGH);  // Activate the buzzer
        Serial.println("Alarm triggered!");
    } else {
        digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, LOW);   // Deactivate the buzzer
    }

    delay(100);  // Debounce delay
}
```

#### Applications
- **Security Systems:** Use the buzzer as an alert mechanism in alarm systems.
- **Notifications:** Provide audible feedback in various electronic projects.
- **Home Automation:** Integrate the buzzer into home automation systems for alerts and notifications.

#### Notes
- **Buzzer Types:** Ensure you use the correct type of buzzer (active or passive) as per your project requirements.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure a stable power supply to the ESP8266 and the buzzer for consistent operation.
- **Debouncing:** If using a button, ensure proper debouncing to avoid false triggers.
